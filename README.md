# Zalig IJsfeest app

### Summary

This project shows an app for an ice cream shop that makes different ice cream cakes to be ordered every year at Christmas.

The project accesses the following data prom a REST API:

* users with different roles
* products and ice cream / sorbet flavors
* orders and order lines
* file upload

All data can be accessed through the Rest API, some data will be only visible for users with certain roles.

Users can Sign Up, Sign In, Add products to their shopping cart, choose pick-up timeslots and payment methods. They can also view all orders they have placed.
Admins can access a separate part of the app to see all orders from all customers and add new products and upload product pictures.

There is still al lot of work to be done before this would be ready for use in the real world, but it gives a good feeling of what the basic need are.


you can run this app:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You do need to run the backend as well, otherwise there will be no data available and the app will not render the home page.
